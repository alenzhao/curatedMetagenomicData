We present *curatedMetagenomicData*, a Bioconductor package that uses *ExperimentHub* to access a large number of processed and curated metagenomic samples from the human microbiome gathered from various sources.

The project is part of a larger pipeline and processes data from the [HUMAnN2](https://bitbucket.org/biobakery/humann2/wiki/Home){:target="_blank"} and [MetaPhlAn2](https://bitbucket.org/biobakery/metaphlan2){:target="_blank"} pipelines. Although much of the pipeline is of little consequence to the end user, it is shown below for illustration.

It is rather the integrated and distributed datasets that *curatedMetagenomicData* delivers most users will find of interest. The package provides taxonomic, functional, and gene marker abundance data that has been highly processed, refined, and curated such that analysis requires a minimum of bioinformatic expertise and no preprocessing of data.

As shown above, problems such as classification, clustering, and correlation analysis can be done in a few lines of code and across multiple studies. The barrier of working with large-scale, raw sequencing data has been abstracted from the process of microbiome data analysis and work that would otherwise have required a computing cluster can be done on a laptop.

It is hoped that, with the provision of resources in *curatedMetagenomicData*, microbiome analysis will be significantly enabled in a manner that is highly reproducible. Finally, into the future, the development of *curatedMetagenomicData* will continue with the addition, curation, and analysis of further microbiome datasets. Shown below is a list of forthcoming datasets that have been chosen for inclusion in *curatedMetagenomicData*.
