Got an interesting analysis you are willing to share? Bring it! We and others will thank you, on social media and we will promise you a beer when we meet in person at a conference. You can 1) create a pull request to this docs/_posts directory, or 2) let us know where to find your script by filing an [issue](https://github.com/waldronlab/curatedMetagenomicData/issues){:target="_blank"}.
