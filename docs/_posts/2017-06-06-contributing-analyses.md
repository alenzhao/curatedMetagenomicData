Got an interesting analysis you're willing to share? Bring it! We and others will thank you, on social media and we'll promise you a beer when we meet in person at a conference. You can:

1. create a pull request to this docs/_posts directory, or
2. let us know where to find your script by filing an [Issue](https://github.com/waldronlab/curatedMetagenomicData/issues){:target="_blank"}.
